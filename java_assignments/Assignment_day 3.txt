What is default package in java
-- java.lang;

List the types of datatypes with size and give an example of each by doing  declaring and initializating the variables.
--  types of datatype present in java
Integer--->byte--->8 bits
	  short -->2 bytes-->16bits
          int     4 bytes   32 bits
	  long    8 bytes   64 bits

ex : 0 to 9 

Decimal   float   4 bytes    32 bits
	  double  8 bytes     64 bits 

ex: 0.0  to 0.9 

Character  char   2 bytes     16bits

ex: A TO Z OR a to z '1'
 
Boolean    boolean -->1 byte  

ex : true or false 


Explain the public static void main(String[] args) in detail.

-- *static is a access specifier 
*if we declare the method as static no need to create an object to call that method 
*jvm calls the main methods 
*classname.methodname    ex: HelloWorld.main();
*public is a access specifier it decides the visibility of class 
*String[] args are also called as CommandLine arguements--->used to pass the value to the main method at runtime 

What are the rules of naming the java file.
-- 1. no space between two words
2. not a keyword
3. no special character apart from _ and $ 
4. name should not start with number 
5. file name should be upper camel case 
ex: StudentDetails
6.filename should be noun
7.filename should be same as classname


what are the rules of naming the class
-- 1. no space between two words

3. no special character apart from _ and $ 
4. name should not start with number 
5. Class name should be upper camel case 
ex: StudentDetails

what are the rules for naming the methods
-- 1. no space between two words
2. not a keyword
3. no special character apart from _ and $ 
4. name should not start with number 
5. method name should be lower camel case

3. no special character apart from _ and $ 
4. name should not start with number 
5. variable name should be lower camel case

which is the main entry point of java program
-- main method is the entry point of the java program

who is invoking the main method of java 
-- JVM is invoking the main maethod.

why main has to be static method
-- The main method in Java is static so that the JVM can call it without creating an instance(Object) of the class that contains it.

components of java program are?
-- JDK, JRE, Class, Main method, methods..

In which area .class is stored?
-- The default classpath is in the current directory

In which area object are stored?
-- Heap Space








//syntax of java programs
package declaration
import statement

class classname
{
//properties
//methods
}

import java.lang;
class Hello$World
{
public static void main(String[] args)//main is a method it is 
//entry point of java program 
{
System.out.println("HelloWorld");
}
}
//static is a access specifier 
//if we declare the method as static no need to create an object to call that method 
//jvm calls the main methods 
//classname.methodname    ex: HelloWorld.main();
//public is a access specifier it decides the visibility of class 
//String[] args are also called as CommandLine arguements--->used to pass the //value to the main method at runtime 




 

class naming conventions 
1. no space bet two words
2. not a keyword
3. no special character apart from _ and $ 
4. name should not start with number 
5. Class name should be upper camel case 
ex: StudentDetails
	Sample
6.classname should be noun


class Hello
{
System.out.println("hello");
}
