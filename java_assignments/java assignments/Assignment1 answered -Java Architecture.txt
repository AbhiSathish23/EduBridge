1>What is java?
 -- Java is a Object Oriented Programing language which is used to develop Variety of applications including mobile app. , enterprise software etc.

2>Who found out the java and when?
 -- James Gosling found java in 1995.

3>What is the latest version of java and list out the versions present so far.
 -- Java SE 23.0.1 is the latest version.
     JDK 1.0 , 1.1, J2SE 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 5.0 , JAVA SE 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23

4>What all the features of java?
 -- It is simple , Platform independent , object oriented, memory management , Multithreaded , Robust.

5>Explain why java is platform independent?
 -- java uses Write once, use anywhere approach , source code is compiled into bytecode , JVM acts as an interpreter and coverts bytecode to human readable format.JVM is platform dependent.

6>Why do we call java is simple?
 -- It does not use two pointers method and so the error making is reduced.
    Memory is allocated automatically

7>Explain architecture of java.
 -- Source file which is in .java file is compiled and converted to bytecode which is .class file. This .class file is not in human readable form. Bytecode is sent to JVM where class loader loads the class and verifies the code and execution engine with JIT complier executes the .class file to .exe file and given to OS and Hardware.

8>Name different memory types and Explain each of them.
 -- Method area : the class, main method is stored.
    Heap area : objects are stored.
    static : all the variable are stored.
    Program Counter Register
    Native Method Stack    

9>Difference between jdk,jvm, jre.
 -- JDK: Used to develop Java applications
    JRE: Used to run Java applications
    JVM: Executes Java programs

10>Name of java compiler and interpreter
-- javac and java.

11>Explain the components of JVM.
 -- Class Loader:it loads .class file and bytecode verifier verifies code and execution engine/JIT compiler.

12>Command used to compile the java program
 -- javac name.java

13>Command used to run the java program
 -- java name.java

14>What is JIT Compiler?
 -- Just In Time , it executes faster.

15>What is the ClassLoader and ByteCode verifier?
-- Class Loader loads the .class file and Bytecode verifier checks the code/instruction is correct.
